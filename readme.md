<!-- The project idea is to allow users to control the popular Subway Surfers game using hand gestures captured from a live video feed. This application combines computer vision and gesture recognition technologies to provide an innovative and immersive gaming experience. Players can control the in-game character's movements by making specific gestures in front of their device's camera. -->
